Haven't done any stats yet
Algorithms can go in _sorts but probably easier to create more files that create seperate csv's and just merge the csv's so running can be done in parts.

number of runs N and number of elements in the unsorted array ARRAY_SIZE are defined in parameters.txt and that are read in the _sorts.py and _sorts.cpp
